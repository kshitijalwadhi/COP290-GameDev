Local Gameplay:

All aspects work. Can play as a single player as well as with two players using the same keyboard (WASD and arrow keys). 


Online Gameplay:

The sockets are working fine. The clients are able to communicate properly using the server. 
However there is an issue that after some time the two clients go out of sync.
This is because I am sending the keyboard commands through the server and long pressing of keys is leading to different inputs. 
Another reason might be due to packet loss since I am testing on the same laptop using two terminal windows during hot summer days in Delhi.
I have tried switching between SDL_Events and SDL_GetKeyboardStates but this didn't really help.
There is another fix that I have tried where instead of sending the keyboard commands through the server, we send the location 
of the sprite through it. There is a demerit to this though that we lose on the animation of sprite if we just switch using that. 
There is a way around though, we can check the direction of movement and play the respective animation however this is not very elegant. 
I am not really sure what's causing this issue but I'll continue debugging this in the coming few days.
